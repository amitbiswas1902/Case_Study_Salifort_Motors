* As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, you have received the results of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has tasked you with analyzing the data to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention.
* To help with this, they would like you to design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their  department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points you deem helpful. 

### Issue/Problem
* Salifort Motors seeks to improve employee retention.
* To answer the following question: What's likely to make the employee leave the company?

* The dataset used was from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv).

## Process

### Tools chosen
The following Python libraries were utilized for the analysis:
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* SciPy
* XGBoost

## Analyze

### Documentation
* The entire analysis and model implementations are documented in the [Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/amitbiswas1902/Case_Study_Salifort_Motors/blob/main/Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb).

## Share

### Executive Summary
* The [Executive_Summary.pdf](https://github.com/amitbiswas1902/Case_Study_Salifort_Motors/blob/main/Executive_Summary.pdf) contains a comprehensive summary of the response, impact and key insights gained by the analysis.

## Act

### Next Steps
* Cap the number of projects that employees can work on.
* Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for at least four years, or conduct further investigation about why four-year tenured employees are so dissatisfied.
* Either reward employees for working longer hours, or don't require them to do so.
* If employees aren't familiar with the company's overtime pay policies, inform them about this. If the expectations around workload and time off aren't explicit, make them clear.
* Hold company-wide and within-team discussions to understand and address the company work culture, across the board and in specific contexts.
* High evaluation scores should not be reserved for employees who work 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding employees who contribute more/put in more effort.
